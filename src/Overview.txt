Truth or Dare Overview

A few twists on the classic "Truth or Dare" game.
We've automated the truth and dare assignment to make things go faster, and added some ways to recognize people for going above and beyond the minimum asked of them.


Rules:
- On your turn, you may choose "Truth" (t) or "Dare" (d).
- The game will give you a prompt from the category you chose. Answer the truth, or complete the dare.
- If you're not comfortable doing it, you may take a penalty instead. (See Penalties)

Extreme Points:
- Sometimes, a person goes above and beyond what's asked of them. Extreme Points are a way to recognize someone for that.

- For each Truth, Dare, or Penalty someone is involved in, you may freely award them 1 Extreme Point if you feel they did more than they had to, and made the game more fun. Use your best judgement.
		EX) Amanda has to take a penalty of wall squats for 1 minute, but decides to go as long as she can. She ends up going for 3 minutes, so you decide to award her an Extreme Point.
	- Someone can be awarded an Extreme Point if they are assigned a Truth/Dare, or if they participate in it.
		EX) Josh is dared to "Touch tongues with Steven." They discuss it briefly, and decide to make out instead. You can award 1 Extreme Point to each of them (or just one of them, or neither).
	- Multiple people can award someone with an Extreme Point for the same epic dare or revealing truth, but you can't give a point to yourself.
	- So, for each Truth, Dare, or Penalty they participate in, someone can get points up to the number of players - 1.
		EX) John is asked to "Tell us a secret" as a truth. He could say something safe, but he opens up and reveals something that makes him feel vulnerable.
			You and two other people are impressed enough to award him an Extreme Point, so he gets 3 points.
			
- You may spend one Extreme Point on anyone's turn to assign someone to also participate in the Truth or Dare just given.
	- They may then take a penalty if they don't want to do it.
	- This can be done multiple times to expand truths and dares to potentially the whole group.
		EX) Matt is dared to sing a song of the group's choosing. He spends 1 Extreme Point to have Geo sing with him.
			Isaiah decides to get everyone involved, and spends 6 Extreme Points to get the remaining 6 people to join in on the karaoke.
			John decides he'd rather take a penalty than sing, so he goes to squat against the wall while the rest of the group sings.
	- You may freely volunteer yourself to participate in a Truth, Dare, or Penalty if it doesn't take any extra time (as in the karaoke example).
	- You must spend 1 Extreme Point to participate if it does take extra time. Almost all truths will require this.
	- However, since you're now participating in the activity, people can award you Extreme Points.
	- Recommendation: Volunteer to participate in any dares that don't take extra time for you to join in. Only volunteer to tell truths that you think you can earn multiple Extreme Points with.
	
- You may spend one Extreme Point at the start of someone's turn, before they choose truth or dare from the program, to assign them a custom truth or dare.
	- Custom truths or dares may be vetoed by the hosts, but you won't lose any Extreme Points just from suggesting it.
	- The person may still take a penalty if they don't want to do it.
	- General policies to help shape your custom truth or dare:
		- Keep it fun! Make it engaging, but don't deliberately try to make people upset or uncomfortable.
		- Keep it short! Either make it so that the game can keep going, or make it something that can be done in under a minute.
		- Keep it safe! No injuring people, damaging stuff, or generally causing lasting harm. This includes toxic rates of drinking, genital exposure or contact, and messes that are difficult to clean.
	- If you're not sure about your truth or dare, ask a host before proposing it! We can help refine it to make it workable.
		EX) Unsafe Dare: "Have someone stand on the opposite side of the room from you. You will each try to hit each other in the face with a pie tin full of whipped cream."
			Safer, but now Long Dare: "Go outside with a paper plate full of whipped cream. Cover someone's body with a trash bag, then press it into their face. Have them hose off before coming back inside."
			Fun, Short, Safe Dare: "Stand in front of the sink. Someone will fill up your mouth with whipped cream until you can't hold any more."
		EX) Not Fun Truth: "What's your favorite color?"
			More Fun, but now Long Truth: "If you were to get a one-time free life makeover, what colors would you want for your hair, wardrobe, and interior design?"
			Fun, Short, Safe Truth: "What's your best guess at the foundation color name to match someone's skin tone?"

Consent:
- This is a game for fun. If anything is NOT fun, speak up so we can find an alternative or fix it.
- If someone hasn't specifically said they're down for something, or declared a policy that implies they're cool with it, ask them.
- Everyone has different boundaries, and if you want to be surprised, try to talk in terms of policies when you're discussing what you're comfortable with.
	EX) Eric: "I'm comfortable with being touched or kissed anywhere that wouldn't be covered by a swimsuit."
	EX) Jack: "Surprise food and drinks are great, but you guys should probably know I'm allergic to gluten and dairy."
- Don't rely on you being the coolest person in the room, and say that you're "comfortable with anything" if you really mean "comfortable with anything you expect other people here will actually do".
