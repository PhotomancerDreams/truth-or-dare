	- Take a shot
		- Volunteers will mix you a shot-sized drink, or a spoonful of some weird but edible concoction.
		- Inform them of your food restrictions (No alcohol, vegetarian, allergies, etc.).
	- Take a note
		- The group will pick a song for you to sing.
		- You don't need to sing the whole thing, so go all out and find a good spot to take a bow.
	- Take a stretch
		- 1 minute of stretching exercises such as wall squats, splits, yoga poses, and so on.
		- Show off your flexibility, but don't hurt yourself.
	- Take a picture
		- A volunteer will draw something on your skin. You choose where.
		- Use washable materials like makeup or food that will come off with soap and water.
	- Take a chance
		- Take a custom truth or dare from another player.
		- When you are deciding on a penalty, others may announce that they have one ready.
		- Once they've explained the challenge, you may take that on or choose a different penalty.
		- A player should never be faced with the same challenge twice. Do it or don't, and move on.
		- If no player announces a penalty, you may reroll a new truth or dare from the game.

	- Take me on
		- Name a short contest. 
		- The group may choose someone to compete with you.
